This directory contains a prototype of building Protobag using XCode. If you're using a Mac and you can CMake installed,
you should be able to build Protobag using the existing CMake build system.  If you need to integrate Protobag into
an iOS or OSX application, please see the root `ProtobagCocoa.podspec.json` file.
